I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Cornell University. My CV is available [here](/cv/). You can reach me at <em>rx24@cornell.edu</em>.

My research is at the intersection of Economics and Computer Science. In particular, I study the role of information in decision-making, and how to design systems that incorporate both human and algorithmic assessments. I am a member of Cornell's initiative on [Artificial Intelligence, Policy, and Practice](https://aipp.cis.cornell.edu/) (AIPP). In Summer 2024, I interned at Microsoft Research New England with [Nicole Immorlica](https://immorlica.com/) and [Brendan Lucier](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/brlucier/).

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Hong Kong with First Class Honours in Comparative Literature and Economics. I also spent a wonderful year at Yale University via the selective [Y-VISP](https://yvisp.yale.edu/) program. 

In a past life, I ride horses and take pictures of stars. View some of my works [here](/life/). 

How to pronounce my name? [Audio](https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&tl=zh-CN&text=%E8%8C%B9%E6%B8%85%20%E8%AE%B8&op=translate).

I am Ruqing Xu (Ru is pronounced like "rou" in "routine" and qing like "ching"). 
"Roo-ching shee"
In particular, I study the role of (algorithmic) information in (human) decision-making and the best way of designing information to achieve socially optimal outcomes.

My recent works engage with this problem from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
